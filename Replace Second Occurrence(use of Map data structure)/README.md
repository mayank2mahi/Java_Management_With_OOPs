# 🔠 Replace Second Occurrence (Case-Sensitive) — Java Program

This Java program takes a string as input and **replaces only the second occurrence** of each **duplicate letter (case-sensitive)** with a `'?'`, leaving all other occurrences unchanged.

If **no duplicate letter** is present, it prints:  
> `No duplicates present in the given string`

---

## 🧩 Features

- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters **separately** (`'A'` and `'a'` are treated as different characters).  
- Replaces **only the 2nd occurrence** of each repeated letter.  
- Ignores spaces, numbers, and punctuation marks.  
- Maintains the **original order and case** of characters in the string.  
- Displays a friendly message if there are **no duplicates**.
